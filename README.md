# VoteBot

## About

This Discord bot allows users to create polls for others to vote. The strings are written in French and refer to a fictitious world, but you can easily modify them. The options include the question, the choices (optional, yes/no, or 1 through 10), the duration (optional, in hours), and the status (optional, official, or not).
